# Solana Perpetuals - Sandblizzard fork

# Notes grizzlython
- Currently the implementation uses Pyth oracles when swapping -> switch out with orderbook dex
- We should still use Pyth or switchboard to get prices for the perpetuals 
- We still need to be able to add collateral for the positions
- There is no frontend so we can create something real cool 
    - Maybe an interface for regular users?
- Might look into bridging tokens from other chains through wormhole 


## Introduction

Solana Perpetuals protocol is an open-source implementation of a non-custodial decentralized exchange that supports leveraged trading in a variety of assets.

## Quick start

### Setup Environment

1. Clone the repository from https://github.com/askibin/perpetuals.git.
2. Install the latest Solana tools from https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools. If you already have Solana tools, run `solana-install update` to get the latest compatible version.
3. Install the latest Rust stable from https://rustup.rs/. If you already have Rust, run `rustup update` to get the latest version.
4. Install the latest Anchor framework from https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/installation. If you already have Anchor, run `avm update` to get the latest version.

### Build

First, generate a new key for the program address with `solana-keygen new -o [PROG_ID_JSON]`. Then replace the existing program ID with the newly generated address in Anchor.toml and `programs/perpetuals/src/lib.rs`.

Also, ensure the path to your wallet in Anchor.toml is correct. Alternatively, when running Anchor deploy or test commands, you can specify your wallet with `--provider.wallet` argument. The wallet's pubkey will be set as an upgrade authority upon initial deployment of the program. It is strongly recommended to make upgrade authority a multisig when deploying to the mainnet.

To build the program run `anchor build` command from the `perpetuals` directory:

```sh
cd perpetuals
anchor build
```

### Test

Unit tests are executed with the `cargo test` command:

```sh
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

Integration tests can be started as follows:

```sh
anchor test
```

By default, integration tests are executed on a local validator, so it won't cost you any SOL.

### Deploy

To deploy the program to the devnet and upload the IDL use the following commands:

```sh
anchor deploy --provider.cluster devnet --program-keypair [PROG_ID_JSON]
anchor idl init --provider.cluster devnet --filepath ./target/idl/perpetuals.json
[PROGRAM ID]
```

### Initialize

A small CLI Typescript client is included to help you initialize the program. Before executing any commands, set `ANCHOR_WALLET` environment variable to point to your wallet:

```
export ANCHOR_WALLET=~/.config/solana/id.json
```

Replace the path above with the correct path to your wallet. `[ADMIN_WALLET]` in the command below could be the same path. CLI script currently accepts only one admin wallet, but the program supports a multisignature scheme for all admin instructions, so you can modify the script to provide multiple admin wallets and enable multisig out of the box.

To initialize the program, run:

```
npm install
npm install -g npx
npx ts-node app/src/cli.ts https://api.devnet.solana.com [ADMIN_WALLET] init
```

Before the program can accept any liquidity or open a trade, you need to create a token pool and add one or more token custodies to it:

```
npx ts-node src/cli.ts https://api.devnet.solana.com [ADMIN_WALLET] addPool [POOL_NAME]
npx ts-node src/cli.ts https://api.devnet.solana.com [ADMIN_WALLET] addToken [POOL_NAME] [TOKEN_MINT] [TOKEN_ORACLE]
```

Where `[POOL_NAME]` is a random name you want to assign to the pool, `[TOKEN_MINT]` is the mint address of the token, and `[TOKEN_ORACLE]` is the corresponding Pyth price account, that can be found on [this page](https://pyth.network/price-feeds?cluster=devnet). For example:

```
npx ts-node src/cli.ts https://api.devnet.solana.com [ADMIN_WALLET] addPool TestPool1
npx ts-node src/cli.ts https://api.devnet.solana.com [ADMIN_WALLET] addToken TestPool1 So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112 J83w4HKfqxwcq3BEMMkPFSppX3gqekLyLJBexebFVkix
```

### Further Steps

To allow users to interact with the program, you need a UI. An open-source reference implementation is under development and will be available soon. In the meantime, you can use the test client available under the `test` directory and the CLI client under the `app/src` directory for examples of how user instructions can be built and executed. Feel free to implement your own version of the UI.
